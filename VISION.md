# K.N. Elettro Intelligence — Vision & Strategy

> Built by one person. In 6 weeks. From inside the factory.

**K.N. Elettro** is a manufacturing company for electrical panel accessories — conduit pipes, cable ties, distribution boxes, glands, and enclosures. Based in India, serving customers across 15+ states.

**ELETTRO Intelligence** is the sales analytics platform born inside this factory — created by a single Analytics Engineer who was hired to "just structure some data" and ended up building an enterprise-grade cloud platform.

## The Problem

90% of Indian manufacturers with ₹5-100 Cr revenue still run their sales analytics on Excel. They export from Tally, paste into sheets, and manually build charts every month. By the time the report is ready, the insights are already stale.

**The result:** Factory owners make ₹50 Lakh decisions based on ₹50 spreadsheets.

---

## Our Solution

**ELETTRO Intelligence** — a cloud-native sales analytics platform purpose-built for Indian manufacturing SMEs.

Upload your invoices once. Get instant dashboards — revenue trends, GST breakdowns, customer segmentation, churn prediction, and geographic heatmaps. No IT team needed. No consultants. No ₹50,000/month SAP licenses.

**₹999/month. Works in 5 minutes. Built by a manufacturer, for manufacturers.**

## One-Liner

> **"From Tally export to boardroom dashboard in 5 minutes."**

---

## Vision Statement

> Every factory owner deserves the same quality of business intelligence that Fortune 500 companies use — without the Fortune 500 budget.
>
> Our mission is to democratize data-driven decision making for India's 6.3 million MSMEs.
>
> Our edge: We are manufacturers ourselves. We don't build for imagined personas — we build for the problems we face every day on the factory floor.
